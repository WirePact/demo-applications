# WirePact Applications

This repository contains various demo/showcase applications for WirePact.
The applications are used during development of translators and for
the end-to-end demo. They vary in terms of programming language
and flavor to show that neither the framework nor the programming language
limits the use case of WirePact.

**Note** that these applications are not meant for production!

## Flavors/Applications

### OIDC Provider (?)

This application serves as "login" point for demo applications that use OIDC.
It is a custom web app with the [node-oidc-provider](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider)
package to deliver OIDC login capabilities. This serves as an alternative to ["Keycloak"](https://www.keycloak.org/)
which tends to have longer startup times for development.
